            "causedBy": "Sclerospora graminicolaProblem Category: Fungal DiseaseSymptoms: The earliest symptoms are chlorosis at the base of a leaf, with subsequent leaves on the plant becoming more and more chlorotic, with the chlorosis always extending from the bases towards the tips of the leaves. The underside of chlorotic leaves develop white powdery or downy growth of sporangia and the spores that they bear. There is a distinct margin between diseased leaf tissue at base of leaf and healthy tissue towards tip. Inflorescences of infected tillers develop the characteristic green-ear symptoms where the grain is replaced by whip-like vegetative structures. Inflorescences can be partially or fully converted to green-ear, depending on the time in inflorescence development at which the infection occurred. Partial green-ear always begins at the base of the inflorescence. Plants infected at an early stage of development, before tillering begins can be killed.Comments: Serious disease in Africa and India, occurs wherever millet is grown.Management: The disease is systemic with the pathogen infecting the growing point of each tiller as the leaf and panicle tissues are being formed. Primary infection is from oospores which are long-lived in the soil. Secondary infection is from the spores produced by the sporangia on the undersides of infected leaves. Oospores are formed in necrotic infected plant material, which then contribute to the inoculum bank in the soil. To reduce infection rogue infected plants when found in the field; treat seeds with an appropriate systemic fungicide prior to planting and continue to spray the crop at least once every 25 days after sowing. Seed treatment Pearl millet downy mildew can be effectively controlled through the use of metalaxyl-based fungicide seed treatments. Application rates as low as 2 g a.i. per kg seed, using specially formulated seed-treatment products, can provide complete control of downy mildew even with highly susceptible hybrids. There is no value of subsequent foliar fungicide sprays following effective seed treatment. On-farm sanitation and selection In situations where resistant cultivars and seed treatments are not available, farming communities can reduce the incidence of downy mildew in pearl millet by on-farm sanitation practices and the selection of seed from robust downy mildew-free plants. Secondary spread of downy mildew within a crop is caused by the spores produced on diseased leaves, so removal of diseased plants or tillers at the first sign of disease should minimise secondary spread. Removal of diseased plants prior to inflorescence emergence, combined with selection of seed for the next season’s sowing from robust, downy mildew-free plants, should also reduce the level of susceptibility in the local cultivar gene pool developing a population of locally DM-resistant cultivars. Sanitation and selection will be more effective if done on a community basis rather than by individual farmers acting alone. The basis for effective on-farm actions is for farmers to fully understand the cause and epidemiology of the disease. Host Plant Resistance Pearl millet downy mildew is best managed by the use of resistant cultivars. Much has been learnt and done in the last 30 years to identify and utilise host plant resistance to this disease, through research done by ICRISAT in collaboration with National Agricultural Research Services (NARS) in India and other countries. In India, the existence of a strong and effective national agricultural research system together with effective public- and private-sector seed companies, has enabled the development and dissemination of a succession of cultivars and hybrids that have a high degree of resistance to downy mildew. The pathogen, however, is variable in its pathogenicity, so that cultivars or hybrids resistant to downy mildew in one region may not be resistant elsewhere. The greatest range of pathogenicity occurs in the Sahel zone of Africa, where the host and pathogen have co-evolved over a long period. Pearl millet hybrids developed for resistance to downy mildew in India have been highly susceptible when grown in the Sahel. Through the ICRISAT-NARS cooperative International Pearl Millet Downy Mildew Nursery program, sources of resistance have been identified that are effective throughout India and right across the African Sahel.Control:  spray  2 times% Cowdung+Asafoetida solution in 10 days interval. or spray 6 litres Fermented buttermilk to control the Downy mildew",

            "causedBy": "Claviceps fusiformisProblem Category: Fungal DiseaseSymptoms: Ergot is a disease of pearl millet grain-bearing heads (inflorescences). The first sign of ergot infection in pearl millet is the appearance of viscous creamy-pink exudations, called honeydew on the flowering heads. Subsequently hard brown spiky structures are formed, called sclerotia.Comments: Ergot reduces grain yields and constitutes a health hazard to humans and animals that consume pearl millet products contaminated with the alkaloid-containing sclerotia of the causal fungus. It is a particularly serious disease of pearl millet F1 hybrids. Biology and Epidemiology: Infection of the individual florets on a pearl millet inflorescence occurs via the stigmas, i.e. the white feathery structures through which the florets are fertilised following pollination. Initial infection is from spores (ascospores) produced from sclerotia in the soil or in crop debris. Secondary infection is from the spores (conidia) produced in the honeydew. Once the stigmas have been pollinated they rapidly wither and are no longer available as the infection route for the ergot fungus. Pearl millet plants are protogynous, with the stigmas emerging before the anthers. Pearl millet F1 hybrids demonstrate synchronous flowering, so that most of the inflorescences in a crop will be at the protogynous stage with little or no pollen available, which makes F1 hybrids particularly vulnerable to ergot infection. Heavy rain at flowering time washes down pollen, extending the period at which the stigmas are available for infection as well as providing ideal conditions for germination and sporulation of the ergot fungus.Management: Ergot can be managed in pearl millet, through the use of host plant resistance, pollen management, avoidance and sanitation. Host plant resistance to ergot can be developed using appropriate inoculation, hybridisation and selection techniques. Sources of host plant resistance are developed and made available by public- and private-sector seed companies. It has been shown in research station experiments that using pollen donor plants to coincide with the protogynous stage of crop flowering can significantly reduce infection in ergot susceptible pearl millet F1 hybrids. Avoidance of ergot is achieved through the selection of cultivars that flower during periods of fine dry weather, so that pollen wash and pathogen germination are minimised. Sanitation measures involve the removal and burning of infected inflorescences as soon ergot symptoms are seen. When this is done at the honeydew stage it will reduce secondary spread within the crop. When done at the sclerotial stage it will reduce the inoculum bank for infections in subsequent seasons and reduce the dangers of consumption of the the poisonous alkaloids getting into food and feed products.Control:  spray  2 times 5% Cowdung+Asafoetida solution in 10 days interval.",

The sori are filled with black spores of the causal fungus, hence the name smut.Comments: Biology and epidemiology: Individual florets are infected by air-borne spores of the causal fungus when the inflorescences are at the protogynous stage. i.e. when the stigmas have emerged before pollination has occurred.

      "fullContent": "The primary symptom of tipburn of mango leaves is necrotic sections around the leaf edges. It is important to figure out the cause of the condition in order to begin appropriate treatment. Tipburn of mango leaves is often, though not always, caused by one of three conditions.\n\na. The plant is not getting enough water\n\nb. Salt has accumulated in the soil.\n\nc. A magnesium deficiency is yet another possible cause of this problem.\n\nAll can occur at the same time, but either one can result in mango leaves with burnt tips. If you water your plant regularly, you are not likely to see tipburn of mango leaves caused by a moisture deficiency. Usually, sporadic irrigation or extreme fluctuations in soil moisture is the kind of cultural care that results in tipburn.  Tipburn caused by fluctuations in moisture can be solved by regularizing irrigation. Set a schedule for watering your plant and stick to it.\n\nSalt Injury: If your plant’s drainage is poor, salt can build up in the soil, causing tipburn of mango leaves. If salt has built up in the soil, try heavy watering to flush salts out from the root zone. If the soil has drainage issues, make drainage channels. Grow sunhemp as green manure crop as intercrop during rainy season and plough back at 50% flowering…This should be practiced atleast 4 to 5 years\n\nMagnesium deficiency: use a foliar spray of compost tea (if organic farmer) potassium chloride KCl 2% (chemical farming). Repeat every two weeks.",

      "fullContent": "Once we have seen the locust outbreaks in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Locusts are short horned grasshoppers which have swarming behavior.  These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gragarious.  Due to changing climate and the cropping practices, these have become serious problem in the last few years.\n\nAs the insects move in large groups, chemical pesticide sprays will not help.  The recommendations made about Ulra High Concentration sprays (95% concentration against normal 5%) of Chemical Pesticides like Malathion (Hazardous), Chlorpyriphos (Highly hazardous) etc., are highly dangerous to environment as it increases pesticide load significantly that too in high concentrations.  Many of these recommendations are based on the practices adopted in desert areas without human habitations or no water bodies whereas now we seeing these swarms in human habitations and if these same chemicals are sprayed the pesticide load increases significantly. This can also kill other non target, beneficial insects and distort the ecological balance and pose severe problem for the next crop season.\n\nInsect Behavior\n\nLocusts lays eggs in SANDY SOILS ONLY so the current swarm which was the result of eggs laid in middle east or in the desert areas of Pakistan or Rajasthan would be already 30 to 45 days old. they may live for another 30 to 35 days which essentially means till end of June Maximum. As they cannot lay eggs and hatch, we do not have fear of new outbreak.\n\nBetter Management Practices\n\nDisrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid\n\nThe best time to treat locusts is when they are in the ‘hopper’ stage, before they can fly. Programs to treat adult flying locusts are generally ineffective. Metarhizium anisopilae fungus to treat locusts is the safest and most effective way to mitigate the impact of locust damage. The fungal spores in the Metarhizium cause an infection inside the locust’s body which leads to death. A kill rate of 90% to 95% can be expected. This fungus multiplies and spreads from insect to insect and create better control.\n\nAs this mode of action is slower when compared to alternative chemicals such as organophosphates and synthetic pyrethroids (which stop feeding within a few hours, and kill locusts within two or three days), crops and pastures treated with this biological insecticde will remain at risk for longer. It can take up to 20 days to kill hoppers under cool conditions (10-14 days under warmer ideal conditions). Note that while it may take 10 – 20 days for the locusts to die, feeding may cease much earlier, so while treated hoppers may remain on crops, they may cause little damage.\n\nSpraying Plant oils\n\nThere are experiments which proved that vegetable oils like neem oil, linseed oil etc (55%) can be sprayed by mixing with sodium bicarbonate solution (45%). This mixture showed more than 80% mortality when mixed with essential oils like clove oil, caraway oil, mint oil etc (1%) for further information https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10340-019-01169-7\n\nSpraying Soil Solution\n\nFarmer Scientists like Venkat Reddy, Telangana was suggesting about using Soil solution to spray. The soil bacteria like Bt were found to be effective as contact killers against borers in the earlier season. This can be tried.",
